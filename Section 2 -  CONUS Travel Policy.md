# Section 2 - CONUS Travel Policy

This section will outline the travel policy for travel within the Contintental United States (CONUS). This policy assumes the traveler is aware of and knows the Defense Travel System (DTS) workflow.

The general workflow is as follows:
  1. Traveler is requested to travel by the customer
  2. Traveler emails the project lead for his/her approval (may be done in conjunction with 1.)
  3. Traveler emails his/her supervisor for approval, with the project lead approval in 3.
  4. Traveler signs DTS orders
  5. Traveler notifies supervisor and project lead of changes if required
 
## 2.1 Travel Authorization(s)
 
Typically the requirement for travel will originate with a customer's project or from an internal requirement. This sectio will treat both situations the same except that in lieu of customer authorization, the traveler may seek approval citing the internal requirement only.
 
### 2.1.1 Project Lead Approval
 
 Prior to creating DTS orders, the traveler will obtain approval from either the ISEC project lead or the customer project lead. This may be, and typically will be, in the form of an email to be attached or forwarded to the traveler's supervisor. At a minimum the project approval must contain the following information:
  - Dates of travel
  - Duty location
  - General purpose of travel (e.g., site survey, system implementation, meeting, design review, etc.)
  
  All travel should derive from a customer project or internal requirement. Obtaining approvel from the project lead ensures that the project is aware of and requested the travel.
 
### 2.1.2 Supervisor Approval

Prior to signing DTS orders, the traveler will obtain approval from his/her supervisor. This may be, and typically will be, in the form of an email chain which contains the project lead approval as described above. The supervisor will approve or deny the request and enter it into the internal travel tracking system as required by the directorate. Each supervisor may require different information in his/her email, but at a minimum, the project approval must contain the following information:
  - Dates of travel
  - Duty location
  - General purpose of travel
  - Daily itinerary
  - Estimated cost
  
 The itinerary information is important for the command to provide personnel accountability and the information will be input into the emergency action center (EAC) travel database by the supervisor as required. Additionally it allows the supervisor to intervene and deny travel which conflicts with other command duties. 
 The estimated cost and daily itinerary allows the supervisor to quickly determine if the proposed travel meets the generual purpose as described in the project lead approval, above.
 
## 2.2 DTS Orders Policy

The traveler will follow the DTS guidelines to create DTS orders. The traveler will not sign the DTS orders prior to obtaining supervisor approval. When DTS orders are signed by the traveler money is obligated, so waiting for supervisor approval ensures both that the suprvisor approves of the travel and also that the supervisor is expecting orders to authorize. 

The traveler may begin, but not sign, DTS orders in order to obtain cost estimate information before supervisor approval. Another valuable tool for cost estimate information is TraX (available from the DTS site).

The traveler will add mandated statements to orders as described in the DTS Mandated Statements Appendix.

## 2.3 DTS Vouchers Policy

The traveler will provide all receipts or a memorandum for record (MFR) for expenses in excess of $5. An example MFR is found in the MFR Appendix.

## 2.4 Changes in Travel

The traveler will notify the supervisor and project lead of any changes prior to or during TDY which will impact the approved travel. Each supervisor may require different information, but at a minimum the notification will include the new dates of travel and an updated cost estimate. The supervisor will update the EAC with new travel dates upon receiving and approving (if applicable) the change in plan.
