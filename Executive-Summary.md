#Executive Summary

In the summer of 2017, the policy to fill out the AMC forms 404 and 1297 for travel was rescinded from higher HQ. This change necessitates a change in this organization's own travel policy and serves as a logical opportunity to ensure the best travel policy is in place moving forward. This document attempts to create a new travel policy with input from as many stakeholders as possible to ensure the best policy is implemented. 

The policy is centered around some core concepts which drive the basis of the policy:
  1. Personnel Accountability
  2. Project Approval
  3. Supervisor Approval
  4. Budget Estimation

The policy is additionally broken into several similar, but distinct, travel categories: CONUS, Non-Foreign OCONUS, and OCONUS. Each category has differences, but are based on the same general process.
