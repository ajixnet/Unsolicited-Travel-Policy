# Section 1 - Purpose

The purpose of this travel policy is centered around providing visibility and accountability in four main areas:
  1. Personnel Accountability
  2. Project Approval
  3. Supervisor Approval
  4. Budget Estimation
  
## 1.1 - Personnel Accountability

The command has a responsibility to maintain personnel accountability of all employees at all times during duty hours. This includes during temporary duty (TDY). This travel policy will attempt to enable personnel accountability by providing supervisors and directors with timely, relevant information prior to - and during, if plans change - the employee's travel.

## 1.2 - Project Approval

It is important that the command have confidence that the travel is requested and approved by the project lead and/or customer organization. This travel policy will attempt to provide the command with justification for the travel.

## 1.3 - Supervisor Approval

The project lead or customer organisation may authorize travel, but the supervisor must also authorize the travel because he/she is familiar with the employee's daily duties and can confirm the travel will not interfere with any organizational duties the project lead or customer organization may not be familiar with. This travel policy will attempt to allow for supervisor approval of the travel.

## 1.4 - Budget Estimation

It is always important to make sure that all money is spent prudently and within the rules. Therefore this travel policy will attempt to allow for budget information such as estimated cost, funding citations, etc. to be communicated to the supervisor, director, and the command.
