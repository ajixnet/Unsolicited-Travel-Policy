# Section 5 - Travel Allowances

This section describes the travel allowances for all travel. 

## 5.1 Terminal Transportation and Parking

The most economical means should be used for travel between home and the airport terminal. For short trips, less than 10 days in duration, driving and parking a personal vehicle at the home airport terminal is typically more economical than using a taxi, rental car, shuttle bus or having someone make a round trip drop. For trips longer than ten days, the traveler should use a one-way rental car, shuttle, or arrange for other transportation. Where multiple travelers are traveling to the same destination, consider booking the same flights, sharing rides to the airport, and sharing transportation at the destination.

### 5.1.1 Parking Rates Allowed

In general, when parking a personal vehicle at the airport, the traveler will only be compensated for the lowest-cost airport parking available. Parking rates by directorate location are described below:

  Fort Huachuca: $5
  Fort Belvoir: $10 (IAD), $17 (DCA), $8 (BWI)
  Fort Detrick: 
  Fort Lee:
  Korea Field Office:
  Hawaii Field Office:

## 5.2 Early Departures

Occasionally travel is required on a flight that departs early in the morning, requiring travel from home or hotel to begin prior to 0600 hours. While every effort should be made to avoid this situation, an overnight stay at a hotel near the airport prior to such a flight can be authorized. Justification for this situation shall require the traveler to verify that no other flights were available at a later time.

## 5.3 Late Arrivals

Occasionally a traveler arrives at the home airport at a very late hour, forcing the traveler to arrive home after 2400 hours. While every effort should be made to avoid this situation, an overnight stay at a hotel near the airport following such a flight can be authorized. Justification for this situation shall require the traveler to explain the circumstances that required an arrival after 2400 hours.
